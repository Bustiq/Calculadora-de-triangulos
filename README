Drawing lines between points in HTML using JavaScript is primarily achieved using the HTML Canvas API. This API provides a way to draw graphics on a web page using JavaScript.
Here's how to draw lines between points on an HTML Canvas:
1. Create the HTML Canvas:
CÃ³digo

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="300" style="border:1px solid #000000;"></canvas>
2. Get the Canvas Context in JavaScript:
JavaScript

const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"); // Get the 2D rendering context
3. Define the Points and Draw the Line:
To draw a line, you use a sequence of methods:
beginPath(): Starts a new path. This is crucial to ensure that subsequent drawing operations are part of a new, distinct shape.
moveTo(x, y): Sets the starting point of the line without drawing anything. Think of it as lifting your pen and moving it to a new position. 
lineTo(x, y): Draws a line from the current position to the specified (x, y) coordinates. 
stroke(): Renders the defined path onto the canvas. This is what actually makes the line visible.
JavaScript

// Example: Drawing a single line between two points
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(50, 50);   // Starting point (x, y)
ctx.lineTo(200, 150); // Ending point (x, y)
ctx.stroke();         // Draw the line
4. Drawing Multiple Connected Lines:
To draw multiple connected lines (a path), you can call lineTo() multiple times after a single moveTo() and beginPath():
JavaScript

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10, 10);
ctx.lineTo(100, 20);
ctx.lineTo(50, 80);
ctx.lineTo(10, 10); // Close the path to form a triangle
ctx.stroke();
5. Customizing Line Properties:
You can customize the appearance of the lines before calling stroke():
ctx.lineWidth = 5;: Sets the width of the line in pixels.
ctx.strokeStyle = "red";: Sets the color of the line.
ctx.lineCap = "round";: Defines the shape of the line's end points (e.g., "butt", "round", "square").
ctx.lineJoin = "bevel";: Defines the shape of the corners when two lines meet (e.g., "round", "bevel", "miter").
